      <!-- IMPORTANT: when adding dependency (module) here, make sure it is a public one.
           Do not add private modules as there is no guarantee they won't be changed or
           removed in future. WildFly also generates warning(s) during the deployment if
           the WAR depends on private modules. -->

      <!-- EXCEPTIONS - private/unsupported modules that can not be directly added into the WEB-INF/lib -->
      <!-- Dom4j is a transitive dependency of org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml and needs to be on classpath.
           It is also used by Hibernate and adding it directly into WEB-INF/lib results in
           "org.dom4j.DocumentException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory cannot be cast to org.dom4j.DocumentFactory"
           Depending on the WildFly module seems to be the only way.
